These are optional AppleScripts that are not installed by default.
They are designed to facilitate Finder-Toolbar interactions.

To make use of them:

Unpack Finder_Toolbar_Applications.dmg

Drag and drop the applications into /Applications/Utilities 
or other suitable location.

Then eject the virtual disk Finder_Toolbar_Applications.

Now drag and drop one or both icons into the finder toolbar.
When you then click on the icon, a Terminal or iTerm will open
and will automatically cd into the directory corresponding to
that Finder window.  (It uses the function posd which will be
autoloaded by default in functions.local.)
